About
-----

I developed this project based on my own design pattern (I created) whose name is "CABIN" (Concrete Abstraction of Interfaces). 
The idea behind is that in order to create an object you need to use a concrete class that extends an abstracted class defined by interfaces, otherwise your code is not really an object.
Let's talk about this later.

------------

Require PHP version 5.5 and greater.

1. Clone this repository and configure your Nginx or Apache to target the main directory.
